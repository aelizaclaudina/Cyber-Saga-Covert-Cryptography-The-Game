# Cyber-Saga-Covert-Cryptography-The-Game
A short interactive game to be run in the console that looks at code-breaking, cryptography and digital forensics.

Welcome to Covert Cryptography, a game that tests your cybersecurity and digital forensic knowledge!

To play please save the two files into one folder to run in whatever you use.

I will be looking at further developing this when I have time to, but for now... enjoy !
